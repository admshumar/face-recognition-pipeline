# Face Recognition Pipeline
Face recognition and segmentation in Python using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [dlib](http://dlib.net/).

This script generates images that depict major intermediate steps that occur during the execution of the face detection algorithm. Finally, it displays the original picture with the facial landmarks found.

Finding facial landmarks has a huge range of potential applications. Some of them include Snapchat filters or face identification.

### Example Pipeline
